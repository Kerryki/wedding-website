    "story.ayomidePOV": "AYOMIDE'S POV",
    "story.arielleP1": "It was the end of April, finals season, and I was living in the library. Papers piled up, deadlines closing in. My world felt small and stressful. Then, in the middle of all that chaos, a random guy walked past me. We looked at each other, smiled, and kept going. Nothing dramatic. Just a moment. We were both too shy to say anything, but somehow it stayed with me.",
    "story.arielleP2": "A few days later, I logged into Instagram and saw a follow request from him. The same guy. I followed back immediately, forgetting any idea of playing it cool. He messaged me, complimented me and true to myself, I replied with a dry \"thank you\" to play it cool. That was it. No conversation. No spark on paper, even though I was so happy about his message. Or so I thought.",
    "story.arielleP3": "After these 2 interactions, I couldn't stop thinking about him. School ended, and with it any chance of accidentally running into him again. So I did something completely out of character. I replied to one of his stories about basketball, a topic I knew absolutely nothing about. I just wanted to talk to him. And somehow, that one small decision changed everything.",
    "story.arielleP4": "...city, constant conversations, growing closer without even realizing how deeply it was happening. I fell in love with Ayomide because from the very beginning, I felt seen, considered, and appreciated. Even in disagreement, he always made space for me to speak, to feel, to be understood. Our disagreements never broke us; they built us.",
    "story.arielleP5": "I knew he was sent from God when I started seeking a deeper relationship with God myself. Ayomide didn't just support that journey, he pushed me toward what was best for me, always with love and patience.",
    "story.arielleP6": "God didn't just send me a partner. He sent me my best friend, my safe place, my soulmate. Whether it was asking me to be his girlfriend or proposing to me, Ayomide has always gone above and beyond.",
    "story.ayomideP1": "It all began in late April, when I was rounding up my university degree and studying for my final exam. I had finished studying for the day and was leaving the library when I locked eyes with a young lady. It was a very brief moment, and we both slowly looked away, but our eyes said the things our lips were too shy to say. As we walked past each other, I engraved a mental picture of her in my mind, and for some reason I had a feeling that this would not be our first and last encounter.",
    "story.ayomideP2": "Sure enough, less than a week later, I was scrolling through my Instagram timeline when I couldn't believe my eyes. Instagram had suggested some profiles that I might know, and the very first one on the list was her. I laughed a little because I couldn't believe my luck. I went on her profile to make sure my eyes weren't deceiving me, and they weren't — it really was her. Now I knew I had to start a conversation with her, but I wasn't sure how. I didn't want to sound too desperate, but I also wanted to say something interesting to catch her attention. After thinking about it for a couple of minutes, I decided the best thing to do was to be polite and tell her I thought she was beautiful. So I added her on Instagram and waited for her to add me back.",
    "story.ayomideP3": "Fortunately, she added me back pretty quickly, which gave me the confidence to message her not long after. She responded quite dryly with a simple thank you, which brought me back down to reality. \"Yeah, she's not feeling you,\" I thought, as all the anxiety from waiting for her response evaporated and turned into disappointment. Even after all this, I still convinced myself that it was okay, and that I would see her again in person someday, and maybe then I would be able to charm her with my words. (Yes, I was delusional ■)",
    "story.ayomideP4": "About two weeks later, I was fully in vacation mode and watching an NBA playoff game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Golden State Warriors. LeBron James, who is my favourite basketball player, had an incredible game. He scored more than forty points and had about ten assists. So I posted what was my first Instagram story in those two weeks, talking about how great of a basketball player LeBron James was, not knowing that his best assist of that night was yet to come.",
    "story.ayomideP5": "Not long after that post, I received a message from the \"young lady,\" agreeing with me about how great of a basketball player LeBron James was. As I read her message, I immediately understood the meaning behind it. I obviously knew she had no idea about basketball or LeBron James, but she was showing interest from her side, and that was all I needed.",
    "story.ayomideP6": "From there, we began to communicate day and night, talking about everything and nothing. Very early on, I already knew that this young lady was going to be my future wife; it was only a matter of when. Our goals aligned, our faith aligned, and our cultures were very similar. It was clear that God had made us for each other and was simply waiting for the perfect time to connect us.",
    "story.ayomideP7": "About two weeks later, we had our first date, then our second a couple of days later, then our third, fourth, fifth — and soon we started to lose count. We became best friends very quickly, and we fell in love with each other even faster.",
    "story.ayomideP8": "Arielle Fabiola Brou Akpele, the \"young lady\" who is now my fiancée, I thank God every day for bringing you into my life. You complement me so beautifully in this life. You are caring, loving, thoughtful, beautiful, gentle, and God-fearing. I also thank your parents for raising you in the way of the Lord and instilling in you the qualities of a woman of virtue, one that I am honoured to call my fiancée.",

    "story.arielleP1": "C'était la fin du mois d'avril, la saison des examens finaux, et je vivais à la bibliothèque. Les papiers s'accumulaient, les échéances approchaient. Mon monde semblait petit et stressant. Puis, au milieu de tout ce chaos, un garçon est passé devant moi. Nous nous sommes regardés, avons souri et avons continué. Rien de dramatique. Juste un moment. Nous étions tous les deux trop timides pour dire quoi que ce soit, mais d'une manière ou d'une autre, cela m'est resté.",
    "story.arielleP2": "Quelques jours plus tard, je me suis connectée à Instagram et j'ai vu une demande de suivi de sa part. Le même garçon. Je l'ai suivi immédiatement, oubliant toute idée de jouer la cool. Il m'a envoyé un message, m'a complimentée et, fidèle à moi-même, j'ai répondu par un sec \"merci\" pour jouer la cool. C'était tout. Pas de conversation. Pas d'étincelle sur papier, même si j'étais si heureuse de son message. Ou du moins je le pensais.",
    "story.arielleP3": "Après ces 2 interactions, je n'arrêtais pas de penser à lui. L'école s'est terminée, et avec elle toute chance de le croiser accidentellement à nouveau. Alors j'ai fait quelque chose de complètement hors de mon caractère. J'ai répondu à l'une de ses stories sur le basketball, un sujet dont je ne connaissais absolument rien. Je voulais juste lui parler. Et d'une manière ou d'une autre, cette petite décision a tout changé.",
    "story.arielleP4": "...ville, conversations constantes, nous rapprochant sans même réaliser à quel point cela se produisait profondément. Je suis tombée amoureuse d'Ayomide parce que dès le début, je me suis sentie vue, considérée et appréciée. Même en désaccord, il a toujours fait de la place pour que je parle, que je ressente, que je sois comprise. Nos désaccords ne nous ont jamais brisés; ils nous ont construits.",
    "story.arielleP5": "J'ai su qu'il était envoyé par Dieu quand j'ai commencé à chercher une relation plus profonde avec Dieu moi-même. Ayomide n'a pas seulement soutenu ce voyage, il m'a poussée vers ce qui était le mieux pour moi, toujours avec amour et patience.",
    "story.arielleP6": "Dieu ne m'a pas seulement envoyé un partenaire. Il m'a envoyé ma meilleure amie, mon refuge, mon âme sœur. Que ce soit en me demandant d'être sa petite amie ou en me demandant en mariage, Ayomide a toujours fait plus que nécessaire.",
    "story.ayomideP1": "Tout a commencé à la fin du mois d'avril, alors que je terminais mon diplôme universitaire et que j'étudiais pour mon examen final. J'avais fini d'étudier pour la journée et je quittais la bibliothèque quand j'ai croisé le regard d'une jeune femme. C'était un moment très bref, et nous avons tous les deux lentement détourné le regard, mais nos yeux ont dit les choses que nos lèvres étaient trop timides pour dire. Alors que nous passions l'un devant l'autre, j'ai gravé une image mentale d'elle dans mon esprit, et pour une raison quelconque, j'avais le sentiment que ce ne serait pas notre première et dernière rencontre.",
    "story.ayomideP2": "Effectivement, moins d'une semaine plus tard, je faisais défiler ma timeline Instagram quand je n'en croyais pas mes yeux. Instagram avait suggéré des profils que je pourrais connaître, et le tout premier sur la liste était elle. J'ai ri un peu parce que je n'arrivais pas à croire ma chance. Je suis allé sur son profil pour m'assurer que mes yeux ne me trompaient pas, et ils ne l'étaient pas — c'était vraiment elle. Maintenant je savais que je devais entamer une conversation avec elle, mais je ne savais pas comment. Je ne voulais pas avoir l'air trop désespéré, mais je voulais aussi dire quelque chose d'intéressant pour attirer son attention. Après y avoir réfléchi pendant quelques minutes, j'ai décidé que la meilleure chose à faire était d'être poli et de lui dire que je la trouvais belle. Alors je l'ai ajoutée sur Instagram et j'ai attendu qu'elle m'ajoute en retour.",
    "story.ayomideP3": "Heureusement, elle m'a ajouté assez rapidement, ce qui m'a donné la confiance de lui envoyer un message peu de temps après. Elle a répondu assez sèchement par un simple merci, ce qui m'a ramené à la réalité. \"Ouais, elle ne te ressent pas,\" ai-je pensé, alors que toute l'anxiété d'attendre sa réponse s'évaporait et se transformait en déception. Même après tout cela, je me suis encore convaincu que c'était bon, et que je la reverrais en personne un jour, et peut-être qu'alors je pourrais la charmer avec mes mots. (Oui, j'étais délirant ■)",
    "story.ayomideP4": "Environ deux semaines plus tard, j'étais complètement en mode vacances et je regardais un match de playoffs NBA entre les Los Angeles Lakers et les Golden State Warriors. LeBron James, qui est mon joueur de basketball préféré, a eu un match incroyable. Il a marqué plus de quarante points et a eu environ dix passes décisives. J'ai donc posté ce qui était ma première story Instagram en ces deux semaines, parlant de la grandeur de LeBron James en tant que joueur de basketball, sans savoir que sa meilleure passe décisive de cette nuit était encore à venir.",
    "story.ayomideP5": "Peu de temps après cette publication, j'ai reçu un message de la \"jeune femme\", qui était d'accord avec moi sur la grandeur de LeBron James en tant que joueur de basketball. En lisant son message, j'ai immédiatement compris le sens qui se cachait derrière. Je savais évidemment qu'elle n'avait aucune idée du basketball ou de LeBron James, mais elle montrait de l'intérêt de son côté, et c'était tout ce dont j'avais besoin.",
    "story.ayomideP6": "De là, nous avons commencé à communiquer jour et nuit, parlant de tout et de rien. Très tôt, je savais déjà que cette jeune femme allait être ma future épouse; ce n'était qu'une question de quand. Nos objectifs s'alignaient, notre foi s'alignait, et nos cultures étaient très similaires. Il était clair que Dieu nous avait faits l'un pour l'autre et attendait simplement le moment parfait pour nous connecter.",
    "story.ayomideP7": "Environ deux semaines plus tard, nous avons eu notre premier rendez-vous, puis notre deuxième quelques jours plus tard, puis notre troisième, quatrième, cinquième — et bientôt nous avons commencé à perdre le compte. Nous sommes devenus meilleurs amis très rapidement, et nous sommes tombés amoureux l'un de l'autre encore plus vite.",
    "story.ayomideP8": "Arielle Fabiola Brou Akpele, la \"jeune femme\" qui est maintenant ma fiancée, je remercie Dieu chaque jour de t'avoir amenée dans ma vie. Tu me complètes si magnifiquement dans cette vie. Tu es attentionnée, aimante, réfléchie, belle, douce et craignant Dieu. Je remercie aussi tes parents de t'avoir élevée dans la voie du Seigneur et de t'avoir inculqué les qualités d'une femme vertueuse, celle que j'ai l'honneur d'appeler ma fiancée.",
